# Overview
This program is targeted to elementary students for the science class. Our software will be an
educational website to teach children the names of the planets and where they are located in the solar
system by grabbing the floating planets with the mouse and dragging them to their correct position.
# Development Environment
This will be a educational website written html, css, python and flask.
The developers will be using VS CODE as their IDE, Github for source control and gimp for media creation.
